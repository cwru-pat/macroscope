"""Macroscope Scripts.

Scripts that are meant to be run just once are located in the main
repository space, up 2 directory levels. This module contains the code
necessary to run these scripts, as well as any appropriate script-like
code. The purpose of housing such code here is to minimize code repetition
and expose the underlying scripts to the command line and import by
other packages.
